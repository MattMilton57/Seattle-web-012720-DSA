# Daily Programming Problems
This repo contains daily programming problems. These challenges should further
your understanding of programming languages, data structures, and algorithms.

Every day someone will receive a programming problem. We will all gather to review the problem. The one person designated to present will write their solution on the whiteboard and get feedback from the class. Whoever presents their solution gets to pick the next problem and volunteer for the next day. Although only one person will present each day everyone should still work on each problem.

Fork this repo and code your solutions there. Do not make pull requests back to
this repo. You can code your solutions in your own forked repo. Staff is able to view your forked repos and your solutions.

This repo will be updated daily. You can view this original repo in your
browser to refer to new daily problem definitions. 

Have fun!
